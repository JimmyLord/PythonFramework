A simple python game framework with a few small examples.

Dependencies:
pyopengl 3.1.5
pygame 2.0.1
imgui 1.3.0

Install with pip:
pip install pyopengl
pip install pygame
pip install imgui

Notes:
pygame and imgui currently have issues with key bindings which I didn't look into.
Some code in main.py currently disables keyboard interaction with imgui.
